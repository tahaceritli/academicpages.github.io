I am a final year Ph.D. student at [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) and the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof. Chris Williams](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/). I was previously a Research Assistant at the [Perceptual Intelligence Laboratory (PILAB)](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/pilab/doku.php) at Department of Computer Engineering of Bogazici University, under the supervision of [Prof. A. Taylan Cemgil](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/).

I am interested in Statistical Machine Learning. Currently, my research focuses on automatizing data wrangling process using machine learning.
